+ check selection theory
+ look for VR code editor
+ continue to use vite
+ no js frameworks (react / solid)
+ no hacking into home environment, instead stay in VR
+ check for keyboard input in App
+ basic interactions: cursor movement + keyboard input + cursor rendering
- slides
  - demo (editor, live reloading?)
  - HMR: problem statement (detail, but not too much)
+ import.meta.hot primitives: use Proxies
+ hot reloading in VR (read/write + CodeMirror editor)

+ fancier interactions with CodeMirror
- potentially use Logitech K380 keyboard passthrough

+ ticks: subclassing erstmal ok, wenn gebraucht: events hinzufÃ¼gen

slides: goals
- most basic way to input text
- live reload text as source code
- build infrastructure on top

demo
+ increase font size
+ VSCode + scrcpy
+ drastischere effekte (planeten stop / go, etc.)

+ write down things
+ cursor interactions
+ remove button
+ Movable: fix handle at (0, 0, 0) and make child (e. g. Editor) responsible for positioning self
  + getSizeInMovable -> getOffsetInMovable
+ RenderPlugin rewrite based on MutationObserver
+ scroller:
  + camera layer + object layer
  - based on render order
  - sub-scene rendering for clipping
+ MovableController
  + set offset
+ SrollableController
  + determines height
  + moves primary selection into view
  + notifies Editor of visibility change
    + only render visible lines (THREE.js add/remove)
+ scroll handle
- iframe using HTMLCanvas for (THREE.js) documentation
- constraint: interaction tweaking only within VR
- controller dragging: z axis multiplier
  - hand space transformation
  - bug?
+ custom mutation observer by recursively listening for childadded/childremoved
- dragging inertia?
- Star Wars: use the force
+ Editor optimization
  + check whether parent is Scrollable
  + check for cursor movements only
- name for movables
- movable rotation modes via button in handle
  - absolute lock
  - relative to user lock
  - look at user while dragging
  - look at user always
  - look at origin always
+ file picker bug: after closing and reopening parent, cannot open children

- open-rpc: open PR
- codemirror-language-server: clone locally, maybe open issue

- Movable lookAt camera
- Text class

- presentation
  - show live coding
    - spawn breadcrumbs of planets
    - show velocity vectors as simple lines
    + light inside of sun
    + primitive button that toggles room light
  + open file picker in Scroller
  + open in front of hands, not feet
  + demo colors, shading + lights
  + ground plane, surroundings
  - demo: show steps as large text
  - explode editor (show 3D)
  + increase z offset of completion
  + Squeak workspace (do it, ...)

  - problem motivieren
  - demo
  - discuss problems
    - HMR
    - editor performance maybe
    - scroller (deep dive nicht so wertvoll)
  - show/discuss self-sustainability
  - limitations
  - future work
  - benchmarks
    - same setup except for multi-pass & clipping
    - without line clipping
    - ...
  - 20-25min

- README with installation and start instructions
- Documentation: how to use the tool (file picker, code editor, ...)
